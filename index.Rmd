# Overview

## Column 1

### Outline
R is rapidly becoming the standard platform for data manipulation, visualization and analysis and has a number of advantages over other statistical software packages. A wide community of users contribute to R, resulting in an enormous coverage of statistical procedures, including many that are not available in any other statistical program. Furthermore, it is highly flexible for programming and scripting purposes, for example when manipulating data or creating professional plots. However, R lacks standard GUI menus, as in SPSS for example, from which to choose what statistical test to perform or which graph to create. As a consequence, R is more challenging to master. Therefore, this course offers an introduction to statistical programming in R. Students learn to operate R, make plots, and do advanced statistical programming and data manipulation. 


The course starts at a very basic level and builds up gradually. No previous experience with R is required.

# Installing R + RStudio

## Column 1

### **1. Install `R`**
`R` can be obtained [here](https://cran.r-project.org). We won't use `R` directly in the course, but rather call `R` through `RStudio`. Therefore it needs to be installed.

### **2. Install `RStudio` Desktop**
Rstudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It can be obtained as stand-alone software [here](https://www.posit.co/downloads/). The free and open source `RStudio Desktop` version is sufficient.

### **3. Start RStudio and install the following packages. **
Please make sure you have a stable internet connection when installing the packages. Execute the following lines of code in the console window:
```{r eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", # Collection: including dplyr (data manipulation), ggplot2 (visualizations) 
                   "magrittr", # Pipe operator
                   "readxl",# Read (input) Excel files
                   "lubridate", # Working with data variables
                   "writexl", # Create Excel output files
                   "MASS" # Statistics (regressions and models)
                   ), 
                 dependencies = TRUE)
```

If you are not sure where to execute code, use the following figure to identify the console:
<center>
  <img src="figures/rstudio_packages.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" width = 50%>
</center>
Just copy and paste the installation command and press the return key. When asked 

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
Do you want to install from sources the package which needs 
compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)
```

type `Yes` in the console and press the return key.
