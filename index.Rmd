# Overview

## Column 1

### Outline
Welcome to our R for Data Analysis Course! 

This comprehensive program will take you from R novice to a skilled data analyst. You'll start by mastering the foundations of R, move on to importing and understanding data, become proficient in data wrangling (including tidying data and data manipulation), learn the art of data visualization, and finally, explore data modeling. 

Our main goals are to provide you with a solid understanding of R, equip you with data analysis skills, and foster critical thinking to uncover the stories hidden within your data. During the course, you'll get the chance to use real-world data from the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) in a practical case study. Whether you're new to R or already have some experience, this course is tailored to help you excel in the field of data analysis.

# Installing R + RStudio

## Column 1

### **1. Install `R`**
`R` can be obtained [here](https://cran.r-project.org). We won't use `R` directly in the course, but rather call `R` through `RStudio`. Therefore it needs to be installed.

### **2. Install `RStudio` Desktop**
Rstudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It can be obtained as stand-alone software [here](https://www.posit.co/downloads/). The free and open source `RStudio Desktop` version is sufficient.

### **3. Start RStudio and install the following packages. **
Please make sure you have a stable internet connection when installing the packages. Execute the following lines of code in the console window:
```{r eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", # Collection: including dplyr (data manipulation), ggplot2 (visualizations) 
                   "magrittr", # Pipe operator
                   "readxl",# Read (input) Excel files
                   "lubridate", # Working with data variables
                   "writexl", # Create Excel output files
                   "MASS" # Statistics (regressions and models)
                   ), 
                 dependencies = TRUE)
```

If you are not sure where to execute code, use the following figure to identify the console:
<center>
  <img src="figures/rstudio_packages.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" width = 50%>
</center>
Just copy and paste the installation command and press the return key. When asked 

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
Do you want to install from sources the package which needs 
compilation? (Yes/no/cancel)
```

type `Yes` in the console and press the return key.
