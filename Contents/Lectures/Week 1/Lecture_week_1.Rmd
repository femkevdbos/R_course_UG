## Assessment - Overview
- Case study using **GSS data**
  - Look at what the **Ghana Statistical Service** has available
  - Choose data that interests you
- Alongside the practical assignments you apply the new skills every week
- Group work: group of 2/3 people for the final assignment
- Individually work on the weekly assignments, but helping each other is encouraged
- Final outcomes:
  - 1: A report describing the data
  - 2: The code you used to write the report
  - 3: A presentation of your findings

## Assessment - Report
1: A report describing the data

  - Key = It should tell the *story* of the data
  - This may NOT include any code
  - Your friends and family should be able to understand this
  - Maximum of 15 pages
    - Front page, table of contents, introduction, methodology, data description, data analysis, conclusion, discussion
  - Not much text necessary, simply tables/figures with clear and concise descriptions
  - Longer reports are not necessarily better!
  - Emphasis should be on the quality of tables, figures, and regression analyses, showcasing the skills acquired during the course
  - **Minimum** of 5 different plots (towards 10 might be better)
  
## Assessment - R Code
2: The code you used to write the report

  - Folder containing R Project, R Script, and dataset used for the report
  - It should be a neatly written script, including comments, following the "tidyverse" styleguide
  - All code for the report should be included (reproducibility!)
  - And also, all code which you used to understand the data and to do checks on the data should be included

## Assessment - Presentation
3: A presentation of your findings

  - Concise summary of your main findings
  - No longer than 15 minutes
  - Prioritize the effective communication of the story the data tells
  - Conclusions should be drawn from the data
  - Any limitations encountered during the analysis should be discussed
  - No explanation of R code!

# Getting started!

# What is R?

## The origin of R
- R is a language and environment for statistical computing and for graphics
- GNU project (100% free software)

- Managed by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria.

- Community-driven

- Based on the object-oriented language S (1975)

## Software

# What is RStudio?

## RStudio
- Aggregates all convenient information and procedures into one single place
- Allows you to work in projects
- Manages your code with highlighting
- Gives extra functionality (Shiny, knitr, markdown, LaTeX)
- Allows for integration with version control routines, such as Git.

## Integrated Development Environment

# Installing R and RStudio

## Installing R and RStudio
### The instructions to install R and RStudio can be found on the **course page**

## Scripts and comments
- You write your code in scripts in R (top-left)
- You can save your scripts, just like saving a Word document
- In your script you can make comments by using **#**
```{r}
# This is a comment
my_exam_grade <- 10 # I can also write a comment like this

# A comment makes the rest of the line be seen as a comment
# this_will_not_work <- 5
```

## Projects in R 
- When you use R you almost always first need to load your data into R
- To do this, R needs to know where to find the documents
- This can be described as your **working directorate**
- To make this easier, we will always work with projects in R:

  1. Make a folder on your computer (for example called: **Programming in R Course**)
  2. Create an R project in this folder
  3. Create a new R script for every practical
  4. Create an `input` and `output` folder to structure input and output files

# How does R work

## Objects and elements
- R works with objects that consist of elements. The smallest elements are numbers and characters.
    - These elements are assigned to objects. 
    - A set of objects can be used to perform calculations
    - Calculations can be presented as functions
    - Functions are used to perform calculations and return new objects, containing calculated (or estimated) elements. 

## Assigning elements to objects
- Assigning things in R is very straightforward: 
    - you just use `<-`

- For example, if you assign the value `100` (an element) to object `trotro_fare`, you would type

```{r}
trotro_fare <- 100
```

- Life hack: In RStudio learn to use the shortcut "alt + -" (hyphen) to produce the left arrow `<-` in an R file
- You run your line of code by Ctrl Enter, or by selecting run at the top right

## Calling objects
- Calling things in R is also very straightforward: 
    - you just use type the name you have given to the object

- For example, we assigned the value `100` to object `trotro_fare`. To call object `trotro_fare`, we would type

```{r}
trotro_fare
```

## Functions
- As explained, R works with functions
- You can make functions yourself
- Many people create functions and make them public, to be used by others
- There are also functions in the `base` package, which is installed for everyone

For example:
```{r}
# If we have 3 different trotro fares, we can make a vector of the fares
trotro_fares <- c(80, 80, 100)

# The function `mean` can then be used
mean(trotro_fares)
```
We are not going to learn a list of functions that exist, but during the course you will learn many different functions.

## Packages
- All functions that are made by others are packaged into packages
- The `base` package is installed automatically, and includes functions like `mean`
- Other packages can be extremely useful
- To use functions from other packages you **once** need to install the package
  - `install.packages("tidyverse")`
- After that you load the library to "activate" the package
  - `library(tidyverse)`
  - You load the libraries every time you restart R 

## The help
- Everything that is published on the Comprehensive `R` Archive Network (CRAN) and is aimed at `R` users, must be accompanied by a help file. 
- If you know the name of the function that performs an operation, e.g. `read_excel()`, then you just type `?read_excel` or `help(read_excel)` in the console and press enter.
- If you do not know the name of the function: type `??` followed by your search criterion. For example `??excel` returns a list of all help pages that contain the word 'excel'
- Alternatively, the internet will tell you almost everything you'd like to know (and then some)
- Sites such as http://www.stackoverflow.com and http://www.stackexchange.com, as well as `Google` can be of tremendous help. 
    - If you google `R` related issues; use 'R:' as a prefix in your search term
- `ChatGPT` and other chat bots can be super useful as well, as you can ask questions and follow with questions to understand codes
  - Be careful of just copying, try to actually learn from it

## How to approach the practicals
- First try to make the exercises yourself
- Use the help to identify the workings of functions
- Ask other students, work together, but make sure that everyone understands the code
- Use Google/ChatGPT
- Ask the lecturer/teaching assistant
- Do not be afraid to try!! Just write code and see if it works!
