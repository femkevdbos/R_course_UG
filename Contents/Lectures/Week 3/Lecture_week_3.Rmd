# Data Wrangling

## What is data wrangling?
"Data wrangling is the process of cleaning, structuring, and transforming data that is suitable for analysis." 

~ Chat GPT 

"It is a crucial step in the data analysis pipeline and is often considered one of the most time-consuming and challenging aspects of working with data."

~ Chat GPT 


Today we split it up into:

1. Tidying data
2. Data manipulation

# Tidyverse package + pipe operator

## Tidyverse
- Tidyverse is a collection of tools for data analysis and visualization
- Split up into multiple packages
- `library(tidyverse)` loads multiple packages:
  - **ggpplot** - data visualization
  - **tidyr** - data tidying
  - **dplyr** - data manipulation
- This is the main package we will use!
  
## Pipe Operator
- Core feature of the tidyverse collection of packages
- In the magrittr package
- We will use the "%>%" operator -> the pipe operator
- Chains together multiple operations in a sequence
- Passing the result of one operation as input to the next operation
- Readability - conciseness - ease of debugging - reproducibility

## Example of the Pipe Operator
```{r}
# Taking the mean
1:5 %>%
  mean()

# Chickweight average weight per diet
ChickWeight %>% 
  group_by(Diet) %>% 
  summarise(avg_weight = mean(weight))
```
Trick: crtl/cmd + shift + m 

# Tidying Data

## Tidy Data
<center>
<img src="figures/tidy_data.png" alt="HTML5 Icon" width = 70%>
</center>
- Each column is a single variable
- Each row is a single observation
- Each cell is a value

## Not Tidy Data
```{r}
# Create "not tidy (ugly)" dataset
ugly_data <- data.frame("column_1" = c("01-01-2023", "01-01-2023", 
                                       "02-01-2023", "02-01-2023"),
                        "market" = c("Makola", "Kaneshie",
                                     "Makola", "Kaneshie"),
                        "product_1" = c(10, 12, 15, 14),
                        "product_2" = c(30, 35, 28, 30))
# Print data
ugly_data
```

## Renaming
- Renaming columns
- Be very careful with this!
```{r}
# What column(s) would you rename?
ugly_data
```

## Renaming
- Renaming columns
- Be very careful with this!
```{r}
# Rename columns (new_name = old_name)
renamed_data <- ugly_data %>%
  rename(date = column_1,
         "pepper container" = product_1,
         "big basket of onions" = product_2)

# Print data
renamed_data
```

## Dates and Times
- Function `as.Date()` such that R knows it is a date variable
```{r}
# Check if it is seen as a date variable
typeof(renamed_data$date)
year(renamed_data$date)

# Change to a date variable, and add year, month, day columns (lubridate package)
data_with_dates <- renamed_data %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date, "%d-%m-%Y"), # Specify format of date here
         year = year(date),
         month = month(date),
         month_name = month.name[month],
         day = day(date))
```

## Dates and Times (continued)
```{r}
# Display data
data_with_dates
```

## Pivoting
- Useful to reshape data
- Remember: 
  - Each column is a single variable
  - Each row is a single observation
  - Each cell is a value
- `pivot_longer()`: lengthens data (cols, names_to, values_to)
- `pivot_wider()`: widens data (names_from, values_from)

## Pivot Longer
```{r}
# Pivot longer
longer_data <- data_with_dates %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("pepper container", "big basket of onions"), 
               names_to = "product", 
               values_to = "price")

# Print data
longer_data
```

## Pivot Wider
```{r}
# Pivot wider
wider_data <- longer_data %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = product,
              values_from = price)

# Print data
wider_data
```

# Data Manipulation

## Dplyr
Main package for data manipulation

- head()
- tail()
- select()
- filter()
- arrange()
- mutate()
- summarize()
- group_by()

## Head 
Display the top rows of the data 

- How does R determine the order of the rows?
```{r}
# Display the top 5 rows
head(ChickWeight, 5)
```

## Tail
Display the bottom rows of the data

- How does R determine the order of the rows?
- Let us use a pipe
```{r}
# Display the bottom 3 rows
ChickWeight %>%
  tail(3)

# Save the bottom 20 rows into a new dataframe
chick_weight_bottom_10 <- ChickWeight %>%
  tail(20)
```
- When is this useful?

## Select
Select columns of your dataset

- Why/when would you use this?
```{r}
# Display columns in data
colnames(ChickWeight)

# Select specific columns
selected_columns <- ChickWeight %>%
  select(Chick, weight)

# Display columns in new data
colnames(selected_columns)
```

## Filter (1)
Filter rows based on specific variable values

- Why/when would you use this?
```{r}
# Filter based on diet
diet_1 <- ChickWeight %>%
  filter(Diet == 1)

# Print data
diet_1
```

## Filter (2)
Additional example
```{r}
# Filter based on weight
weight_over_300 <- ChickWeight %>%
  filter(weight > 300)

# Print data
weight_over_300
```
What other examples could you think of?

## Arrange
Arrange data either by value or alphabetically

- Why/when would you use this?
```{r}
# Arrange by weight - automaticall ascending
arranged_data <- ChickWeight %>%
  arrange(weight)

# Display top and bottom
head(arranged_data, 5)
tail(arranged_data, 5)
```

## Arrange (2)
You can also arrange by descending order
```{r}
# Arrange descending - method 1
descending_weight_1 <- ChickWeight %>%
  arrange(desc(weight))

# Arrange descending - method 2
descending_weight_2 <- ChickWeight %>%
  arrange(-weight)
```

## Mutate
Mutate columns or create new columns

- Why/when would you use this?
```{r}
# Add additional column specifying the weight classification
chick_weight_classified <- ChickWeight %>%
  mutate(weight_class = case_when(weight < 50 ~ "less than 50",
                                  (weight >= 50 & weight < 100) ~ "50-99",
                                  (weight >= 100 & weight < 200) ~ "100-199",
                                  (weight >= 200 & weight < 300) ~ "200-299",
                                  weight >= 300 ~ "300 and more"))
# Display data
head(chick_weight_classified)
```

## Summarise
Summarise your data

- Why/when would you use this?
```{r}
# Summarise the average weight
ChickWeight %>%
  summarise(average_weight = mean(weight))

# Summarise the total unique number of chicks in the data
ChickWeight %>%
  summarize(distinct_chicks = n_distinct(Chick),
            count = n())
```

## Group by
Group data, very useful!

- Why/when would you use this?
- Can often be combined with summarising!
```{r}
# Group by weight classification and summarise number of chicks
chick_weight_classified %>%
  group_by(weight_class) %>%
  summarise(distinct_chicks = n_distinct(Chick))
```

- How would you improve this?

## Group by (continued)
Many applications!!
```{r}
# Group by weight classification and summarise number of chicks
chick_weight_classified %>%
  group_by(Diet) %>%
  summarise(distinct_chicks = n_distinct(Chick),
            average_weight = mean(weight))
```
Can you think of more ways to use it?
